# bot-san

My attempt at making a ~~simple~~ discord bot
------------------------------------------------------------------

Has simple bot functionality/commands, also as a bet function that uses RiotAPI (mainly league of legends currently) to do simple wagers/bets on ongoing matches.

Todo:
- [x] Complete testing of simple functions
- [ ] Complete Bet functionality
  - [x] League of Legends
  - [ ] Apex Legends
- [ ] Complete testing
